This is a bash script that backs up your current working directory and all sub directorys by copying them into a tar file, and then compressing it into a 7z file.

Has four command line arguments available:

-f	Folder to save the backup.
-I	Input extra folders or files to backup.
-E	Exclude a folder or file to backup.
-C	Check if you have permission for all of the foldersand files you are adding.

Still putting the finishing touches on it, so it might not work yet.
